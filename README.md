This project focuses on developing a Student Information System (SIS) for a local school. The current management system at the school relies heavily on paper-based processes, which leads to inefficiencies and challenges in handling and organizing data. The goal of this project is to replace the existing paper-based system with an internet-based system, enabling the school community to perform their tasks online.
